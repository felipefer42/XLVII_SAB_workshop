    "## S-PLUS: Accessing and Analyzing S-PLUS Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will focus on two essential tools for accessing and manipulating these data: splus.cloud and the splusdata package. splus.cloud is the official data distribution platform for S-PLUS, allowing researchers and enthusiasts to download catalogs and images directly from the cloud. The splusdata package, on the other hand, is a library in Python designed to facilitate the search and processing of these data efficiently, integrating into the development environment.\n",
